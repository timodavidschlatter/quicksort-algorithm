# Implementation of Quicksort Algorithm

## Description
I implemented the quicksort algorithm in Java. Quicksort is an efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that has an average time complexity of O(n log n).

## Features

- Pivot Selection: Uses always the pivot on the left
- In-Place Sorting: Sorts the array without requiring additional space.
- Edge Case Handling: Includes checks for edge cases such as negative integers.
- Comprehensive Tests: A set of unit tests covering typical, edge, and performance cases.
- Performance Analysis: Detailed performance comparison with other sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort and Heap Sort, in the README file.
